## What it does
We made a website that allows people to learn math from well known influencers/characters.
We take learning with fun to the next level

## How we built it
* We put the experiences of our users first and thought what would be the most fun for them 
* We planned every step ahead of time 
## Challenges we ran into


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* We worked wonderfully as a team with great communication
* The gifs, emojis, and memes were the perfect touches to our website
* We created a clean user interface 

## What we learned
* Teams of friends are the best things one could ask for 
* Roles can delay progress, sometimes its best 
* Breaks can improve results 10x
* Looking at everything required in the submission is more important than rereading the instructions.

## What's next for Angel Math
* A HuggingFace account is all that is needed to make user accounts, there will be no need to have 2 accounts
* Communities built around this funny platform 
* More added to resources, lessons, quizzes,
